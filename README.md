# COVID Trend Visualization Dashboard - Tableau

## Project Overview

This project involves creating an interactive Tableau dashboard that visualizes COVID-19 trends across various continents, countries, and the percentage of the population infected. The dashboard also includes forecast indicators and heat map for the top-infected countries, helping users understand the spread and impact of the pandemic.

## Key Features

- **Continental COVID Trends**: Visualize COVID-19 trends across continents, including Asia, Africa, Europe, Oceania, North America, and South America.
- **Country-Specific Analysis**: Observe individual countries' infection rates using a heat map for better geographic visualization of COVID-19 spread across continents.
- **Population Infection Count**: Analyze the no of people infected in each country and continent, providing a clear perspective on the pandemic's reach.
- **Forecast Indicators**: Implemented forecast indicators for top-infected countries, projecting future trends and helping stakeholders prepare for upcoming challenges.
- **Visual Comparison**: Compare COVID-19 trends between continents and countries to understand regional differences and responses.

## Technologies Used

- **Tableau**: Used for data visualization and dashboard creation.
- **SQL**: Utilized for querying and preparing data for analysis.
- **Excel/CSV**: Data sources containing COVID-19 statistics, population data, and trends.

## How to Use

1. Open the above-mentioned [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1cT59RTz8cv-7U7kxXaEOGgsi9ir2uRS0?usp=sharing)
2. Open the Tableau file (.twb or .twbx) to explore the dashboard and its interactive features.
3. Use dynamic interactions to customize the data view based on continent, country, and time period.
4. Navigate through the dashboard to analyze COVID-19 trends and forecast indicators across different regions.

## Key Insights

- **Top-Infected Countries**: Identify the countries with the highest infection rates using Heat Maps and forecast future trends.
- **Regional Comparisons**: Compare COVID-19 impact across continents to understand variations in infection rates and population impact.
- **Population Impact**: Gain insights into how the pandemic has affected different populations based on infection percentages.

## Future Enhancements

- **Vaccination Data**: Integrate vaccination data to correlate with infection trends and provide a more comprehensive analysis.
